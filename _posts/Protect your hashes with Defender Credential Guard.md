Introduction:

Defender Credential Guard increases the security of derived domain credentials by taking advantage of platform security features including, Secure Boot and virtualization. It uses virtualization-based security to isolate secrets (credentials) so that only privileged system software can access them. Credential Guard prevents these attacks by protecting NT LAN Manager protocol (NTLM) password hashes and Kerberos Ticket Granting Tickets.
