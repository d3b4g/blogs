#### Enumeration 

To begin the enumeration process, a TCP port scan was run against the target using nmap. The purpose of scan is to quickly determine which ports are open and which services are running. 

##### OS Information:

###### Open Ports:
In addition to usual ports, 22 and 80 UDP port 161 is open. UDP 161 is the standard SNMP port.
