### Active Directory Reconnaissance for Blue Teams 

Once compromised a machine in an Active Directory environment, threat actors perform domain reconnaissance against Active Directory to learn more about the environment. For any user on the network it is really easy to pullout information from active directory because active directory has no way of distinguishing whether the request came from a valid source or from an adversary.The best defense is to get ahead of the hackers and catch the loophole in your systems. 

In this post, i will use an Active Directory visualization tool called Bloodhound to discover attack paths before an adversary can leverage them.
