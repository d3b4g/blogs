### Active Directory Reconnaissance for Blue Teams 

Once compromised a machine in an Active Directory environment, threat actors perform domain reconnaissance against Active Directory to learn what users, systems and groups exist in a domain, who has what privileges, and what tasks systems perform. With this information the attacker can focus on where they need to go and what accounts need to be compromised to successfully exfiltrate the target information. Domain reconnaissance is very difficult to prevent because AD has no way of distinguishing whether the request came from a valid source or from an adversary.The best defense is to get ahead of the hackers and catch the loophole in your systems.
