#### Active Directory Enumeration - BloodHound

In this post i'm going to take to you through demostration of working with bloodhound to enumerate active directory. Bloodhound automates complex enumerating tasks we used to perform with powershell or anyother tool.

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify.
