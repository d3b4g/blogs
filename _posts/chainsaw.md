**Chainsaw** is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack. This box is about Solidity, Ethereum Blockchain and IPFS Exploitation. 

#### Enumeration

To begin the enumeration process, a **TCP/UDP** port scan was run against the target using nmap. The purpose of scan is to quickly determine which ports are open and which services are running. 

###### OS Information
Based on the Apache version, it looks like we are dealing with Xenial / Ubuntu 16.04 based system.

###### Open Ports and Services :
In addition to usual ports

+ Port 21 : FTP Server which allows anonymous login
+ Port 22 : SSH Server
+ Port 9810 : A webserver ?

###### Anonymous FTP:

```python

âžœ  chainsaw ftp 10.10.10.142
Connected to 10.10.10.142.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.10.10.142:root): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> dir
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 1001     1001        23828 Dec 05  2018 WeaponizedPing.json

226 Directory send OK.
ftp> mget *
```
We have got three interesting files from FTP server, after a bit of researching i found out these files are party of a etherum smart contract.

WeaponizedPing.json - A compiled Solidity smart-contract in JSON format
WeaponizedPing.sol - .sol extention means its an Ethereum smart-sontract written in Solidity
address.txt - Possibly an address on a blockchain where the contract is been deployed.

#### What is a Smart Contract ?

> A smart contract is an agreement between two people in the form of computer code. They run on the blockchain, so they are stored on a public database and cannot be changed.

**Lets take a look at the solidity code:**
WeaponizedPing.sol

```python
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

contract WeaponizedPing
{
  string store = "google.com";

  function getDomain() public view returns (string)
  {
      return store;
  }

  function setDomain(string _value) public
  {
      store = _value;
  }
}
```

+ Smart contracts is written in Solidity. It is a contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
+ A getDomain function and setDomain which accepts a string_value. 
+ The getDomain function  retrieves the current value of the domain string
+ setDomain set a value for the domain string
