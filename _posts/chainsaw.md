**Carrier** Chainsaw is a retired vulnerable VM from Hack. This box is about smart contract exploitation.

#### Enumeration

To begin the enumeration process, a **TCP/UDP** port scan was run against the target using nmap. The purpose of scan is to quickly determine which ports are open and which services are running. 

###### OS Information
Based on the Apache version, it looks like we are dealing with Xenial / Ubuntu 16.04 based system.

###### Open Ports and Services :
In addition to usual ports

+ Port 21 : FTP Server which allows anonymous login
+ Port 22 : SSH Server
+ Port 9810 : A webserver ?

Quickly checking VPN reveals some interesting files, downloaded all the files to local machine.
```python

We have got three interesting files from FTP server, after a bit of researching i found out these are components of a smart contract

WeaponizedPing.json - A compiled Solidity smart-contract in JSON format
WeaponizedPing.sol - An Ethereum smart-sontract written in Solidity
address.txt - Possibly an address on a blockchain where the contract is been deployed.
