#### Background


**Sizzler** is a a really tough windows box. 

#### Enumeration

To begin the enumeration process, a **TCP/UDP** port scan was run against the target using nmap. The purpose of scan is to quickly determine which ports are open and which services are running. 

###### OS Information
Based on the system we know it is running some version of windows server

###### Open Ports:
In addition to usual ports, 22 and 80 UDP port 161 is open. UDP 161 is the standard SNMP port.There is also a filtered ftp port showing.

#### Notes:
- There are a lot of ports open and by looking at the open ports we know it is most likely a windows active directory setup.

#### HTTP - TCP 80
Gobuster did find an interesting directory **certenroll**  which is microsoft certificate authority enrolement service.
```python

/aspnet_client (Status: 301)
/certenroll (Status: 301)
/Images (Status: 301)
/images (Status: 301)
/index.html (Status: 200)
```
But visiting that directory show us 403 forbidden

#### SMB - TCP 445
Using SMB client i was able to get bunch of shares.

```python

sizzle smbclient -N -L \\\\sizzle.htb.local

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        CertEnroll      Disk      Active Directory Certificate Services share
        Department Shares Disk
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share
        Operations      Disk
        SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```
Notes:
- From the shares i noticed the CertEnroll which is used by Microsoft Certificate Authority. From my years of experience with managing windows Active directory environments /certsrv 

Visting that directory pop us for a username and password

So we need a username and password to access /certsrv, lets enumerate the SMB shares further.

There is nothing interesting in department shares and most of the folders are empty.

From all the folders we have Full access to  /Users folder.

#### SMB Share â€“ SCF File Attacks

When we have read/write access to a SMB file share, we can performa a SCF file attack to steal NetNTLMv2 hash.

After uploading the malicious SCF file, we wait for responder

And we got user Amanda's NetNTLM Hash

#### Hash Cracking

Feed  the captured hash to hashcat to crack it.

And we got the password.
