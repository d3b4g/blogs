OpenAdmin is rated as a Easy Linux box. It was released on 04 Jan 2020 and has been created by @dmw0ng

This box required us to perform the following tasks:


- Enumerate a web server to find vulnerable web application


## Initial reconnaissance
Letâ€™s do first a full nmap port scan using the following command:
> nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/initial

We have SSH on 22, and an Apache 2.4.29 HTTP server running on 80

Lets see what is running on port 80

Which is running OpenNetAdmin - v18.1.1

A quick searchsploit shows this version of OpenNetAdmin is vulnerable and there are public exploits available.

I didnt want use metasploit module for this, so i quickly grabbed the exploit available from exploit database.
Had weird issues running the code, due to spacing i belive, so i quickly converted the script using dostounix tool.

Running the exploit give us a shell as www-data
