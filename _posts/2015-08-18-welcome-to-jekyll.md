Just moved my blog from wordpress to Jekll to save few $$ on webhosting. Jekll is an awesome blog aware static website generator written in ruby.I'm using leonid Jekll theme by @renyuanz. Still in the process of migrating old posts from the blog to github pages.Hopefully i can move all old post soon.
