## Introduction
Recently while i was doing a Hackthebox machine which involves binary exploitation and ROP, i was really struggling to make things works. so to improve my pwn and ROP skills i decide to do various ROP challenges, im starting with ROP Emporium challenges. These challenges use the usual CTF objective of retrieving the contents of a file named "flag.txt" from a remote machine by exploiting a given binary.
ROP theory is out of scope of this article, If you want ROP theory there are lot of good resources out there.

## Description 
Locate a method within the binary that you want to call and do so by overwriting a saved return address on the stack.
Click below to download the binary. 

### About the Binary:
Our binary is usual ELF executable in 64-bit architecture.

PIE isn't enabled so the binary will be loaded at a fixed location into memory (0x400000) everytime.With nx set to true, we know shellcode cannot be executed off the stack and we know binary has ASLR disabled.

## Analyzing the 64bit ELF binary
Lets load the binary with GDB and dump the functions.
```

0x00000000004008b0  __libc_csu_fini
0x00000000004008b4  _fini
```
Here we can see interesting functions:
- main()
- pwnme()
- ret2win()

So lets see what this fucntions does!
