<dib>I like breaking stuff, mainly interested in exploit development and offensive security. Currently Working as an Infomation security engineer in the Banking sector.  
I started this blog to share my experience, struggle and research mostly related to information security.  
The opinions on this blog are strictly my own. There is absolutely no affiliation with my employer or anyone else.
